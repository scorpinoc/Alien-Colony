# Alien-Colony

simple app from some hackathon quest

Plan for develop ("must be" things):
* Whole colony state statistics:
  * real time;
* Alian colonists data:
  * create new, edit, delete;
  * (?) manage statistics of anyone of colonists;
* Alien colonists jobs:
  * create new, edit, delete;
  * manage statistics by job;
* Emergency emulating (enemy attack, earthquake, diseases, ets.):
  * create new;
  * colony reaction on emerency;
  * (?) statistics of emergency "results";
* Planet:
  * status;
  * new planet creation;
  * (?) special planet effects;
* Save to file:
  * statistics reports;
  * colony;
* Map:
  * colony map;
  * buildings;
  * (?) realtime moving;
* Different users;

(?) - last one to do
